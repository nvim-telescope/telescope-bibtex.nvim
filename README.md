# telescope-bibtex

Search and paste entries from `*.bib` files with [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope).

The `*.bib` files must be in the current working directory.

Provides the command `BibtexPicker` to list the entries.

To quickly use this put something like this in your init.vim: `inoremap <leader>p <cmd>BibtexPicker<cr>`
